## What is MCP-RS?

MCP-RS is a robust, type-safe Rust implementation of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) designed for AI-agent integration. It provides a standardized JSON-RPC interface for AI agents to interact with various services and tools.

## Key Features

- 🚀 **High Performance**: Built on tokio for async operations
- 🔒 **Type Safety**: Leverages Rust's type system for reliable protocol handling  
- 🔌 **Plugin Architecture**: Extensible handler system for custom integrations
- 🌐 **Multi-Transport**: Support for stdio, HTTP, and WebSocket protocols
- ⚙️ **Configuration-Driven**: TOML-based configuration with environment variable overrides

## Current Status

MCP-RS is currently in active development with WordPress integration and core infrastructure complete. The project is suitable for development and testing environments.
